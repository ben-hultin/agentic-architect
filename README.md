# Agentic Architect

This repository hosts a collection of AI Engineering projects demonstrating agentic architectures and workflows using Python and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services.

Each project is designed as a standalone example, showcasing different patterns, tools, and best practices for building intelligent systems.

## Projects

### 1. [LangChain RAG GCP Simulation](./langchain_rag_gcp)
A simulated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system mirroring a GCP-native architecture (Vertex AI, Cloud Storage, Cloud Functions).
- **Stack**: Python, FastAPI, LangChain.
- **Features**: Ingestion pipeline, vector search simulation, and RAG serving API.
- **Goal**: Demonstrate RAG pipelines offline without requiring live cloud resources.

## Goals
- Provide reference architectures for AI agents on GCP.
- Explore integration with tools like LangChain, LangGraph, and Vertex AI.
- Implement best practices for modular, testable AI codebases.
