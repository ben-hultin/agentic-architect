Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a suite of cloud computing services offered by Google.
It runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, Google Drive, and YouTube.
GCP provides a series of modular cloud services including computing, data storage, data analytics, and machine learning.
Key services include Compute Engine for virtual machines, Cloud Storage for object storage, and Vertex AI for building ML models.
Google Cloud also offers serverless computing options like Cloud Functions and Cloud Run.
Security is a major focus, with data encryption at rest and in transit by default.
