LangChain is an open-source framework designed to simplify the development of applications powered by large language models (LLMs).
It provides tools for chaining together various components, such as prompt templates, LLMs, and document retrievers.
LangChain supports many use cases, including chatbots, document analysis, and autonomous agents.
It offers standard interfaces for memory (keeping track of conversation history) and tools (allowing agents to interact with the outside world).
LangChain integrates with many vector stores like FAISS, Pinecone, and Chroma for RAG applications.
The framework is available in both Python and JavaScript/TypeScript.
